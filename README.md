# Sign-To-Speech-Translator

# Overview
This repository contains the code, Power BI dashboard, and datasets for the project titled "Sign To Speech Translator": A Python-Based Approch. The goal of the Sign-to-Speech Translator project is to bridge the gap between hearing and hearing-impaired individuals by converting sign language into spoken language, leveraging machine learning and computer vision.

# Project Structure
The **Sign-to-Speech Translator** project utilizes machine learning and computer vision to convert sign language gestures into spoken language. It involves data collection (gesture videos/images), preprocessing (feature extraction), model training (gesture recognition using deep learning), and speech synthesis (text-to-speech conversion). The project includes components like datasets, model files, Python scripts for processing and training, and documentation. It aims to improve accessibility for hearing-impaired individuals by creating a real-time translation system.

# Methodology
The methodology for a **Sign-to-Speech Translator** typically includes:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather sign language datasets using video or image recordings.
2. **Preprocessing**: Use computer vision techniques (e.g., OpenCV, MediaPipe) to extract features like hand landmarks and gestures.
3. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) on preprocessed data to recognize gestures and map them to corresponding text.
4. **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: Implement TTS models to convert recognized text into speech.
5. **Evaluation & Optimization**: Validate model accuracy and refine it based on metrics and feedback.
6. **Deployment**: Integrate the system into a user-friendly interface for real-time translation.

# Result
The **Sign-to-Speech Translator** achieved real-time translation of sign language gestures into text and speech, bridging communication gaps for hearing-impaired individuals. It demonstrated accurate gesture recognition using deep learning models and effective speech synthesis via TTS tools, providing an accessible and inclusive solution.
